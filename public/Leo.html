         <h2 class="title1">Leo Zodiac Sign</h2>
         <p class="paragraph1">Bold, intelligent, warm, and courageous, fire sign Leo is a natural leader of the Zodiac, ready to blaze a trail, vanquish injustice, and make a name for themselves along the way. Blessed with high self-esteem, Lions know that they possess enviable traits—and they're proud of them. They don't believe in false modesty and will be the first to praise themselves for a job well done. But Leo isn't self-aggrandizing or unwilling to roll up those sleeves and do the work: this sign knows that in order to be respected and admired, he or she needs to put in the effort worthy of a leader.</p> <br> <br>
         <p>But it's not all hard work for Lions. Intense and energetic, Leos thrive on social interactions and have no problem making friends—although pinning them down to spend time with you is another story. Leos put themselves first, and will turn down a plan that doesn't fit with their agenda or idea of fun. This trait has gained them an unfair reputation for arrogance. But on the flip side, when a Lion chooses to spend time with you, it's genuinely because he or she wants to.
            Leos are passionate in all pursuits, including relationships, and take it upon themselves to be the best partner you've ever had. They love grand gestures, and they want to show the world how attentive and caring they can be. They also can't resist flashiness and often buy their partner the biggest and best presents. Leo is an adventurer, seeking to balance an intense life of social obligations and travel with plenty of downtime to relax and luxuriate. Work and outward appearances matter to this sign, and they're willing to do whatever it takes to gain a job title or workplace status, even if it means temporarily sacrificing their precious leisure time.</p> <br> <br>  <br>
         <p>Benevolent with their time and attention, Leos are never cliquey, always showing friendliness and politeness to everyone. While almost everyone else is entranced by the Leonine personality, Leos are their own harshest critic and consider each day a challenge to be the best, brightest, and boldest Lion they can be.</p> <br> <br>  <br>

        <h2 class="title1">Leo' Greatest Gifts</h2>
        <p class="paragraph1">A natural leader, Leo's very presence inspires others to be the best they can be. But with great power comes great responsibility. Leos love the pull of the limelight, and they're occasionally swayed by what other people want (or expect) them to do. Although this sign has a loud inner voice, learning to listen to it—especially if it's guiding them toward an unpopular move—is a lifelong lesson that will only make proud Lions stronger and more resilient.</p> <br> <br>

     <div class="definiton">
        <h2 class="title1">Leo Greatest Challenges</h2>
        <p class="paragraph1">Lions are well known for their loud roar. But learning to quiet down and listen is essential for Leos to reach their peak power—especially when they're hearing a voice that doesn't match their confidence and certainty. And while this sign thrives on their split-second decision-making and reaction skills, they might sometimes benefit from taking a few seconds, minutes, or even days before making their opinion known on a subject. Researching all sides, doing due diligence, and learning from other people's experiences are all essential for a Leo to be as strong a leader as possible.</p> <br> <br>

        <h2 class="title1">Leo Secret Weapon</h2>
        <p class="paragraph1">A giving nature. Most people assume that Lions are all about themselves. But appearances are deceiving. A Leo's secret weapon is his or her boundless capacity for love, affection, and generosity.</p> <br> <br>

        <h4>The 5 Top Reasone to Love Being a Leo</h4> <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Whether you plan it or not, you're always the center of attention. Might as well learn to revel in it!</li> <br>
            <li>You have a loud voice and are a pro in debating and getting people to see (and eventually agree) with your side. Using your voice for good is a passion.</li> <br>
            <li>You never run out of energy. As a Lion, a 20-minute catnap will fully recharge you so that you can dance all night long.</li> <br>
            <li>Although you're one of the first signs to step up and speak out when you see injustice, your innately gentle spirit invites people to trust you.</li> <br>
            <li>You love the good life. You work hard for your money. Why not enjoy it by indulging in the best, most sparkly, boldest accessories, outfits, and ephemera that money can buy</li>
