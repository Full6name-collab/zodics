         <h2 class="title1">Pisces Zodiac Sign</h2>
         <p class="paragraph1">Smart, creative, and deeply intuitive, 
             Pisces can be close to psychic. Pisces feel things deeply,
              and have incredibly strong gut reactions. A Pisces "knows" 
              things from deep within, and can often judge whether a person or situation is good or bad.
               That doesn't mean a Pisces ignores the logical part of their brain, though. 
               Deeply intelligent, Pisces have a profound respect for the power of the human 
             mind. Is it a surprise that Albert Einstein was a Pisces?</p> <br> <br>
         <p>Pisces are sensitive, and get along well in small groups of people. Sometimes,
              a Pisces may feel like they have an internal and external self, and they may
               need to spend a lot of time solo to recalibrate those two halves of themselves.
                A Pisces is rarely lonely when they are by themselves, and have an active imagination.
                 Creative, Pisces love spending time reading, exploring or creating art or music,
              and understanding their emotions through art.</p> <br> <br>  <br>
              <p>Pisces may seem quiet but they are incredibly strong and have a very strong sense of 
                  right and wrong. Their moral compass, along with their gut, guides them well. When a 
                  Pisces speaks up, people listen. Pisces tend to take in everything around them, and they 
                  are great people to ask for advice on pretty much anything. While Pisces has strong 
                  convictions about the best way for them to live, they have a "live and let live" approach 
                  when it comes to others, and are accepting and nonjudgmental of all.</p> <br> <br>  <br>

        <h2 class="title1">Pisces' Greatest Gifts</h2>
        <p class="paragraph1">A Pisces has a great gut and great 
            intuition, which can guide them well, and help them make 
            creative or intellectual leaps other people might not be 
            able to see or consider. Deeply imaginative, Pisces can 
            happily spend hours daydreaming, and are often just as 
            surprised as the rest of the world when the pieces come 
            together in an amazing way. Pisces don't necessarily work 
            the same way as other people do, and they may be able to 
            get things done incredibly quickly. But it's not that they're that much faster 
            than other zodiac signs. It's that the time they may have been caught staring 
            into space are times that are deeply valuable to them, and necessary for any 
            creative process. The more a Pisces understands how 
            they work and respects that process, the better they are.</p> <br> <br>  
     </div>
     <div class="definiton">
        <h2 class="title1">Pisces Greatest Challenges</h2>
        <p class="paragraph1">Pisces can sometimes spend too much time in their heads, getting 
            overly wrapped up in a problem and assuming there's no solution. Pisces are always 
            one of the first signs to lend an ear to others, but when it comes to asking for help—especially 
            emotional help—Pisces can sometimes wall themselves off, assuming that nobody knows what they 
            are feeling and not even giving anyone a chance to try. Learning how to open up can be a huge 
            lesson for Pisces. Of course, the fact remains that no one can read a Pisces mind. Pisces 
            sometimes feels frustrated that they are seen as "more complicated" than their peers, and 
            that feeling can make them act or seem defensive. Pisces needs to learn to let down their guard, 
            allow people to love them, and allow for mistakes to be made.</p> <br> <br>  
     </div>
     <div class="definiton">
        <h2 class="title1">Pisces Secret Weapon</h2>
        <p class="paragraph1">The realization that life is so much more than what we see. Pisces is in tune with the magic of everyday existence and can find beauty in all situations, even ones that may cause tears. Recognizing these moments of beauty and being able to share them with others is what makes Pisces a creative sign, and is also what makes Pisces a soulful sign.</p> <br> <br>

        <h4>The 5 Top Reasone to Love Being a Pisces</h4> <br>
        <ol>
            <li> Your intuition is spot-on. No need to go on a date. You know that person is bad news from first look.</li> <br>
            <li>Your playful sense of fun. It may not be as obvious as other signs, but you have a childlike view of the world that you can unleash, spending hours happily looking for shells with your kids.</li> <br>
            <li>Your lack of judgment. What other people do is their business, but you'll always take the time to listen to them and offer your thoughts and opinions—but only if asked.</li> <br>
            <li>Your love of nature. You truly believe we are all connected, and you inspire people with the way you understand the rhythm of the seasons.</li> <br>
            <li>Your cool factor. You don't care if people think you're cool—which makes you that much more impressive. You set trends, call the shots, and lead by example, and don't even break a sweat.</li>
        </ol> <br> <br>
